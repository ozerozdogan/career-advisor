### 7.1 Roadmap Generation Endpoint

**Endpoint:** `/api/roadmap`  
**Method:** POST  
**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "jobTitle": "string"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": "string",
      "name": "string",
      "description": "string",
      "type": "primary | secondary | tertiary",
      "group": "string"
    }
  ],
  "links": [
    {
      "source": "string",
      "target": "string",
      "type": "string"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 7.2 OpenRouter AI Prompt

The key to the application is the prompt used with OpenRouter API:

Generate a detailed learning roadmap for a {jobTitle}. The response MUST be a valid JSON object with the following structure:

```
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": "string",
      "name": "string (short title)",
      "description": "string (concise explanation, max 300 chars)",
      "type": "primary | secondary | tertiary",
      "group": "string (group name)"
    }
  ],
  "links": [
    {
      "source": "string (parent node id)",
      "target": "string (child node id)",
      "type": "string"
    }
  ]
}
```

Requirements for the roadmap structure:
1. Create a hierarchical structure with main categories and their sub-components
2. Use appropriate node types to indicate importance:
   - primary: Very Important (light blue background)
   - secondary: Important (yellow background)
   - tertiary: Normal (light orange background)
3. Group related technologies and concepts together
4. Create meaningful connections between nodes

   - Python (primary)
   - Golang (secondary)
   - JavaScript (tertiary)

2. Operating Systems:
   - Linux (primary)
